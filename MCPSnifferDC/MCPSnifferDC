# Enable Automap to securely map back to the _homexl_ share on this MCP
# Note, setting this option requires you to ensure that the AUTOMAP.PS1 script
# is the first entity to read from STDIN inside the built container.
# Also note that if AUTOMAP.PS1 does not exist when the build process
# encounters the #$SET AUTOMAP 'M: \\192.168.16.5\_HOMEXL_', it will
# create the current version of AUTOMAP.PS1 for you. 
# Also note the similarity to an MCP compiler control record, but since
# it starts with #, Docker sees it as a comment.
